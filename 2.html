    This page contains a list of all completed specifications and drafts by the CSS WG (formerly ‘CSS & FP WG’).
    If you want to follow the development of CSS3, this is the place to start.
    You have ideas? Contributions? See ‘If you want to help’ on this page.
A specification is not a manual.
There is no excuse for badly written drafts and please complain if you find one.
But specs do target a specific audience. See fantasai's Understanding the CSS Specifications..
J. David Eisenberg has written another useful How to read W3C specs.
r you can read about ‘modules,’ ‘levels,’ ‘snapshots’ and the CSS process.</p>
